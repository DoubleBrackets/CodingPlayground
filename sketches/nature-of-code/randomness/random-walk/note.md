### Random-Walk
Various random walks.
- Uniform 4-Direction: Equal chance of any cardinal direction
- Uniform 8-Direction: Equal chance of any of 8 directions + standing still
- Right-Skewed 4-Direction: 40% right, 20% left, 20% down, 20% up
- Mouse-Skewed 8-Direction: 50% to move towards mouse, 50% uniform 8-direction
- Gaussian random walk: Samples gaussian distribution (mean = 0, std = 1) and steps that many pixels

Honestly kind of fun to watch.

### Nature of Code
A series of sketches made following the [Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/introduction/) web tutorial series!

If this sketch is empty it's because I haven't finished the series yet...
 
When I finish I'll make a cool sketch that combines the concepts into something neat :D

I'll be adding sketches from individual chapters as I slowly do them in my free time. Most of the sketches are variations of the exercises/examples in the web tutorials, with parts of the code taken from that.

### Dots
Click + Hold to interact!

Flipping panels. I remember seeing this in a few places before, but don't remember...

Faux-3D effect was done by just offsetting/scaling two circles using sine/cos of the rotation, respectively. The middle was filled in with a rectangle scaled in the same manner.

Each Dot has a "target rotation" and has a spring force towards it. Default target is based on scrolling perlin noise, but click + hold sets it to 0 (facing up)

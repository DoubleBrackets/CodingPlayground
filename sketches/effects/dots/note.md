### Dots
Flipping panels. I remember seeing this in a few places before, but don't remember...

The circles look a little squashed because there's actually two circles slightly offset and rotated to get a fake 1px thickness. Forcing the angle to be some minimum amount away from completely vertical also does something similar.
